								<h3><strong>What is an art+NFT?</strong></h3> 
								<br>
								<p>To us, an art+NFT is thought-provoking or stunningly beautiful. It’s made with love and fun and heartbeat, inspires and connects people worldwide, building friendships and partnerships. <br><br> It’s a digital or digitalized artwork, much like a physical painting or a sculpture, safely stored in the blockchain and therefore exempt from all the logistics and storage hassle. <br><br> art+NFTs are a new, an additional way, to collect art. Our collaboration with [moha.berlin - MUSEUM OF HIGH ART, BERLIN] enables collectors to rent their own virtual showroom,  thus showing their collections to the world. <br><br><br></p>
							</div>
							<div id="#02">
								<h3><strong>How to buy an art+NFT? (strategically)</strong></h3> 
								<br>
								<p>There will be numerous strategies. Let us present two: <br>
									<strong>art+NFT buying strategy #1 </strong>
									Follow your heart. See it. Love it. Buy it. <br><br>


									<strong>art+NFT buying strategy #2</strong>
									Buy one artwork of each artist from all 48 shows.
									In twelve years, there will be very few people to own a full collection. <br><br><br>
								</p>
							</div>

							<div id="#03">
								<h3><strong>How to buy an art+NFT? (technically)</strong></h3>
								<br>
								<p>There are three ways to acquire an art+NFT. <br>

								01. As a Club Member, you will see a button to buy or reserve an art+NFT once you connect your wallet. All art+NFTs of all artists of all 48 shows will have the same price of 1,850 ETH including VAT plus gas fees. Please be aware, that we have a purchase limit of 12 art+NFTs per show. <br><br>


								02.If you are not yet a Club Member, <a href="/collectors-club-membership-application/" style="color:#3e4044;">you may apply here</a>. Application and membership are and will be free of charge. There is no obligation to own art+NFTs. It’s totally okay if you wish to join the club just for its networking opportunities.  <br><br>


								03.If you do not wish to become a Club Member, you can buy from the secondary market on OpenSea. In that case, please consider that all buyers will have paid 1,850 ETH. We’re not giving away art+NFTs for free, not even for marketing or brand building purposes. Our collectors are typically using FU Money to grow their collections. It’s therefore, quite likely, that collectors expect a 3x, 5x or 10x return on their investment. Club Membership is certainly worth considering.   <br><br><br>

								<h3><strong>Top 5 reasons to buy an art+NFT</strong></h3>
								<br>
								<p>
									<strong>#5 There is no fuzz attached</strong><br>
									Presently, most NFT-series on the market have some sort of investment plan attached. art+NFTs are exempt from that. They are the equivalent of buying artwork in a high street gallery. <br><br>


									<strong>#4 Unlimited storage and always on display</strong><br>
									Collecting physical artworks is usually limited by storage capacities. art+NFTs are safely stored electronically, in the Ethereum blockchain. art+NFTs empower you to show your collection, wherever you want.  <br><br>


									<strong>#3 Trading without intermediaries</strong><br>
									A wide range of platforms allows collectors to trade art+NFTs without an intermediary broker.  <br><br>


									<strong>#2 It’s simple. </strong><br>
									See it. Love it. Buy it. <br><br>


									<strong>#1 It’s art.</strong><br>
									Art has been a driver for innovation for more than 300.000 years. <br><br><br>
